# Simple Color Lib 🎨

This is meant as a simple colour library for my own learning. I built it initially within another project, where I wanted programmatic colour shifting for highlights and shadows on a UI. When I came to build another project and needed the same functionality I decided to make this reusable.

## Development

- Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

- Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

- Build the library:

```bash
npm run build
```
